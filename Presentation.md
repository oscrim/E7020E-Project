# Presentation of the project: E-Toaster

##Introduction

We wanted to upgrade a toaster to be able to start it via a bluetooth module. We also wanted to make it display information with the use of a screen.
The information we wanted to display were the temperature (get by a sensor) or a message when the bread is ready.
We also tried to implement a system of LEDs to see when the bluetooth module is working or the duration of the toasting.
